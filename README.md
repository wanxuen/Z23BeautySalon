                                   Welcome to our Z23 Beauty Salon’s website!

First and foremost, to run our program, you’ll need to download the all of the files inside our ZIP code into a file named “Z23BeautySalon”. A sample of all of the files needed in our directory are as seen below.

Figure 1: File list
However, it is important to note that the file list in Figure 1 does not include our pdf report and this readme file.

Once all the files are imported, it is compulsory to ensure that the “Z23BeautySalon” file is saved under the “www” file that is under the wamp server. An example of the file path can be seen in Figure 2.

After importing all of the files, you will need to proceed to import our database into PhpMyAdmin. The database has been named “database.sql” and can be seen down below in Figure 3.

However, do remember to press the import button after choosing the database file for a complete import. After importing the file, the website will be able to run properly with the help of the WAMP server. You can run the server by entering the following path into the search bar:

localhost/Z23BeautySalon/

Hence, this is the end of our guide to run our website. We hope you enjoy surfing through our website and do not hesitate to reach out to contact us through (wanxuentan02@1utar.my)  if you encounter any problems. Thank you!
